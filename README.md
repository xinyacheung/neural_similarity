*data: cue images and electrode monkey spike data sample from [1];

*neuralcode: process neuronal data from monkey spike data and get representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM);

*NNmodel: the CNN-LSTM model example was fed the same movies as that presented to monkeys in the monkey experiments
and closely replicated their training procedure;

*demo: Example codes for plotting the data figures in the main text.
