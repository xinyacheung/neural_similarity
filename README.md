# neural_similarity
code for paper 'Adaptive stretching of representations across brain regions and deep learning model layers'

*data: cue images and electrode monkey spike data sample from [1];
*neuralcode: process neuronal data from monkey spike data and get representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM);
*NNmodel: the CNN-LSTM model example was fed the same movies as that presented to monkeys in the monkey experiments
and closely replicated their training procedure;
*figure: Example codes for plotting the figures in the main text.
